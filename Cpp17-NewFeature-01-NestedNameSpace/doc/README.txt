In C++ 17, namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups, to group different entities such as: classes, methods and functions under a name. 
the namespaces is also designed to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries. 
All identifiers at namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification.
